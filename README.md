üèÄ **Knowledge Graph for Basketball Analytics**

This project constructs a Knowledge Graph that semantically models key concepts in professional basketball‚Äîsuch as teams, players, officials, and arenas‚Äîusing a custom-built ontology and RDF data.

**Overview**
By defining rich semantic relationships among these entities, we create a structured, interoperable representation of basketball knowledge. The graph allows for both exploratory queries and implicit reasoning, enabling insights that go beyond raw data.

**Key Features**
Ontology-Driven Design: All data is modeled using an ontology that captures the domain semantics of basketball.

Data Integration: Aggregates heterogeneous sources (teams, players, games, arenas) into a unified, queryable format.

Semantic Querying with SPARQL: Supports advanced queries such as
"Which team won the most games in the 2019‚Äì20 NBA season?"
or
"Who were the referees in a specific match?"

Reasoning Support: Reveals implicit facts by modeling indirect relationships (e.g., inferring referee assignments from game metadata).

Explainability & Traceability: All answers and inferences can be traced back through the graph, ensuring transparency and justification.

**Why Use a Knowledge Graph?**

This approach transforms raw sports statistics into a semantic network that is:

  1. Navigable ‚Äì Easy to explore using linked relationships

  2. Interpretable ‚Äì Understandable by humans and machines

  3. Extensible ‚Äì Easily supports additional data or concepts
